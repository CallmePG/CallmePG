- 👋 Hi, I’m @CallmePG
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development
- 🌱 I recently completed my web development courses, am focusing on applying my skills to real-world projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, tailwind and bootstrap, and even explore more
- 📫 You can reach me via email, anupraisegodpg@gmail.com.
- 😄 I'm waiting for your mail.
- ⚡ When am not coding, you can find me designing (graphically) or anything printing related.
I work more with Visual Studio Code, am thinking of exploring Adobe Dreamweaver for my coding projects
I mostly work with Adobe Suites Applications for my designs, so I feel it will be flexible to use Adobe Dreamweaver
